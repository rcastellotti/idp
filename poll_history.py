"""A simple(?) example for using the starlink_grpc module.

This script shows an example of how to use the starlink_grpc module to
implement polling of status and/or history data.

By itself, it's not very useful unless you're trying to understand how the
status data correlates with certain aspects of the history data because all it
does is to dump both status and history data when it detects certain
conditions in the history data.

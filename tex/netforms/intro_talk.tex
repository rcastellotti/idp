\subsection*{Topic}

\todo{Add Motivation: Why is this topic relevant? Which ``big'' problem does it solve?}

In this IDP project we will investigate Starlink internals. Starlink is a project from SpaceX aiming to provide fast internet connection
anywhere in the world. We aim to understand in detail internal routing decision, general behaviour for handling incoming packets and
understand how satellite handovers are performed.
We plan to fuzz the dish interal GRPC dishy api to see if we manage to get access to internal statistics.
Additional information will be extracted by dissecting the Android application provided to manage the dish.
Eventually we will develop some tooling to interact with the API, in order to abstract some of the logic in the event 
someone wants to perform some measurements, additional tooling may be developed to understand how satellite handovers are made. 

\subsection*{Related Work}

There is not much literature about internals of the dish and about the API, there's an interesting hardware-level hacking talk given at DEFCON.

We found some reasearch regarding measurements \cite{10.1145/3517745.3561416} \cite{10.1145/3517745.3561457}

\begin{researchquestions}
\item Are there ani hidden API endpoints?
\item How satellite handovers are performed?
\item Can we extract some data that helps us verify the data the API is offering?
\end{researchquestions}

\subsection*{Approach}
In the first part we will make measurements and statistic evaluations to
ensure, that the acquired data, which comes from the SDR, is valid.  Therefore
we will test, if the samples are valid right after the internal tuning phase of
the SDR.
We will also investigate whether or not external influences such as the USB
interface interfere with the process.
Other influence such as the quantization error will also be analyzed.
The latter are of particular interest when it comes to replay of previously
recorded signals.
The second part is about the scanning application itself.
The program can use the wide range of the present USRP hardware, which covers a
frequency range from 75\,MHz to 6\,GHz.
The tool would scan the whole band for online investigation or store the
samples for later use.
Further more, you will be able to rescan narrow bands of the spectrum to have a
closer look whats happening there.
The UI will consist of a zoomable heatmap (waterfall diagram) interface with
mouse support.

To get proper values to display, we have to consider different parameters like
integration time and gain settings etc.
These parameters will also be part of the research.
The software will be based on the GNUradio software defined radio
framework.  The additional work is planed to be done with python3.
The used hardware consists of 2 URSP b210, where for the main part only one is
needed.

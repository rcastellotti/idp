  abstract  = {With new Low Earth Orbit satellite constellations such as Starlink, satellite-based Internet access is becoming an alternative to traditional fixed and wireless technologies with comparable throughputs and latencies. In this paper, we investigate the user-perceived performance of Starlink. Our measurements show that latency remains low and does not vary significantly under idle or lightly loaded links. Compared to another commercial Internet access using a geostationary satellite, Starlink achieves higher TCP throughput and provides faster web browsing. To avoid interference from performance enhancing proxies commonly used in satellite networks, we also use QUIC to assess performance under load and packet loss. Our results indicate that delay and packet loss increase slightly under load for both upload and download.},

  abstract  = {LEO satellite "mega-constellations" such as SpaceX's Starlink, Amazon's Kuiper, OneWeb are launching thousands of satellites annually, promising high-bandwidth low-latency connectivity. To quantify the achievable performance of such providers, we carry out a measurement study of the spatial and temporal characteristics as well as the geographic variability of the connectivity provided by Starlink, the current leader in this space. We do this by building and deploying a browser extension that provides data about web performance seen by 28 users from 10 cities across the world. We complement this with performance tests run from three measurement nodes hosted by volunteer enthusiasts in the UK, EU and USA. Our findings suggest that although Starlink offers some of the best web performance figures among the ISPs observed, there are important sources of variability in performance such as weather conditions. The bent-pipe connection to a satellite and back to earth also forms a significant component of the observed latency. We also observe frequent and significant packet losses of up to 50\% of packets, which appear to be correlated with handovers between satellites. This has an effect on achievable throughput even when using modern congestion control protocols such as BBR or CUBIC.},
